This repo was created to satisfy my curiousity with responsive design frameworks. Here I decided to test out [Foundation](https://http://foundation.zurb.com/) and re-work an original personal project to test the responsiveness across all platforms.


####Technologies Used:

		- Foundation Framework
		- HTML5
		- CSS3
		- JQUERY
		- TypeType plugin
		- Adjector plugin
		- Chrome Dev Tools
		- My Android  Mobile Device for remote Debugging
